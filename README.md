# Cross Traffic Management for Autonomous Vehicles
This repository contains the code for an autonomous vehicle traffic management 
system designed to improve safety and efficiency at intersections. 
The system is built using Python and FreeRTOS, and utilizes object 
detection and tracking algorithms to detect other vehicles 
and pedestrians in the intersection.
